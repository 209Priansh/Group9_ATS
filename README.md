The objective of this project is to minimize the cost of recruiting a
candidate for the company. You have to scrape through the profiles
which are publicly available on github folder , and using NLP
techniques extract the features from the resumes. Then arrange them
in a structured form to create a database of required skill sets. Later
develop a resume Automatic Tracking System (ATS) model which
maps these profiles with the Job description using a score.
